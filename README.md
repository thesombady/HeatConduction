# HeatConduction
This repository is for computational experiment "Heat Transfer" for the course Fysb21 at Lund university given in 2021. Feel free to have a look.
# Clarification
In this computational experiment, one investigates the heat-transfers in a one-dimensional case, shown below.

Moverover, one also generalizes this to two dimension. This was then tested with a astroid impact on the surface of the earth; Results are viewable in the code, but also a .gif file is the repository.
## Disclaimer
As this is a computational experiment, some things might be flawed; The problem I sought to solve was computational-time.
